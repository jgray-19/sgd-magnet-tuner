"""The loss normalisation must be one constant shared by every closed-twiss worker.

The fitter sums the workers' losses. Anything a worker divides its own loss by is
therefore a re-weighting of that momentum in the joint fit, and if the divisor is
derived from the worker's own data it re-weights by an accident of that data
rather than by any physics.

That is exactly what used to happen: each worker divided its weights by its own
largest weight and its loss by its own point count, so the optimiser minimised
``sum_w (1/(max_w * N_w)) * chi2_w`` while the reported 1-sigma - built from the
un-normalised ``JᵀWJ`` - described the pooled ``sum_w chi2_w``. The point estimate
and its error bar belonged to two different estimators.

These tests are pure arithmetic on the payloads and the worker's weight
alignment; no MAD-NG process is started.
