"""Physics integration tests for the closed-twiss fitter on PSB.

Each test perturbs real magnets, generates a *fake measurement* by twissing the
perturbed machine, and then recovers the perturbation through the real
``ClosedTwissFitter``. Because the synthetic measurement is produced by an
independent twiss of the same lattice, a successful recovery exercises the whole
chain end to end: the parametric ``mo=2`` map, the ``trkopt`` derivative columns,
the phase-advance differencing, the inverse-variance weighting across observables
in different units, and the Gauss-Newton solve.

The physics being asserted, test by test:

``test_quadrupole_gradients_recovered_from_beta_and_phase``
    Beta and phase respond to quadrupole gradients but the closed orbit does not
    (a gradient error steers nothing when the orbit through it is centred), so
    this isolates the newly added optical-function observables. A pure
    closed-orbit fit cannot see these errors at all, which the test asserts
    directly.

``test_vertical_dispersion_requires_a_vertical_source``
    The physics motivating the whole fitter: vertical dispersion is identically
    zero in an ideal flat machine, so a non-zero measured ``Dy`` can only be fitted
    by a knob that deflects vertically. Quadrupole ``dy`` feed-down is such a
    source; quadrupole gradients are not. The test asserts both directions.

``test_observables_are_consistent_with_an_independent_twiss``
    The values the worker reports through ``trkopt`` must equal an ordinary
    twiss of the same machine, and their knob derivatives must equal finite
    differences of it. This is the unit-level guard that the monomial encoding
    selects the derivative it claims to.

``test_orbit_jacobian_matches_finite_differences``
    The same guard for the closed orbit, which takes the *other* code path (saved
    map rather than ``trkopt``), over every steering family: ``dx``, ``dy`` and
    ``tilt``. A wrong Jacobian here does not error, it just quietly stops the
    orbit from being fitted.

``test_second_momentum_removes_the_null_space``
    What a second momentum actually buys, measured on the normal matrix rather
    than assumed.

``test_quadrupole_tilts_recovered_from_vertical_dispersion``
    An injected tilt pattern recovered from the vertical orbit and dispersion.

``test_all_observables_fitted_simultaneously``
    The whole point: orbit, beta, alpha, phase and dispersion driven to agreement
    in one solve, against a machine perturbed in gradient *and* alignment.
