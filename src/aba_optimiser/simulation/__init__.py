"""
Simulation module for creating simulated accelerator data.

This module contains components for setting up MAD-NG simulations,
applying magnet perturbations, calculating beam optics, generating
tracking coordinates, and processing simulation data.

Recommended approach: Use the interface classes directly from aba_optimiser.mad
for MAD operations, which provide better encapsulation and object-oriented design.
