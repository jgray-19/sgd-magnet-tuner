"""Fit bends and quads to closed orbit + phase, and hand back a closed-orbit reference.

Why this exists
---------------
A transverse-momentum reconstruction needs the closed orbit's *angle*
``px``/``py`` at every BPM. BPMs measure position only, so the angle can come
from nothing but a model -- and a nominal model that does not carry the machine's
real magnet errors supplies an angle that is simply wrong. On PSB ring 3 with
realistic dipole errors the nominal model's angle error *equals* the true angle:
it contributes nothing.

Fitting the errors from a plain closed-orbit measurement fixes that, but only if
three things are right at once. Each was established by measurement, not
assumption (see NOTES_offmom_investigation, sections E and F, in the tmom-recon
repository):

1. **Regularise.** 80 knobs against 17 BPMs at realistic resolution, fitted with
   no prior, is *worse than not fitting at all* -- the recovered error vector
   comes out ~6x larger than the true one as the fit absorbs noise into
   compensating magnet errors. A modest Tikhonov prior swings the same data from
   2.7x worse than nominal to 22x better. This is the single most important
   setting here, which is why it has a non-zero default.
2. **Match the knob families to the observables.** The closed orbit is nearly
   blind to gradient errors: a quadrupole on a centred orbit produces no
   deflection. Giving an orbit-only fit free quadrupole knobs therefore makes it
   ~2.6x *worse*, because the knobs only add noise-absorbing freedom. Phase does
   respond to gradients, so with phase included the same quad knobs pay off ~4x.
3. **Use more than one momentum.** At a single momentum the per-magnet Jacobians
   are degenerate; see :class:`~aba_optimiser.workers.common.ClosedTwissData`.

Observables
-----------
The default is closed orbit plus phase advance, deliberately. Phase needs no
amplitude calibration, and unlike beta-from-amplitude or a model-derived
``DPX``/``DPY`` it does not feed a modelled quantity back into a model fit. Beta
and dispersion are available through *observables* for callers whose measurement
genuinely supports them.

Consuming the result
--------------------
:class:`MomentumReference` is plain data: fitted knob values and a per-BPM
closed-orbit frame carrying ``x``/``y``/``px``/``py``. A downstream
reconstruction takes those without importing anything from this package.

The reference is a *momentum origin*, not just an orbit: a reconstruction
expressed against :attr:`MomentumReference.closed_orbit` sees only what the
measurement has in excess of that orbit, so what it needs is the offset **from**
:attr:`MomentumReference.reference_pt`, never the measurement's absolute ``pt``.
The off-momentum study measured the difference at a reference sitting
:math:`3\\times10^{-3}` off the origin: using the absolute ``pt`` as if it were
the offset degrades the reconstructed ``px`` from 4.741e-4 to 7.702e-2, against
1.162e-3 for the offset -- a factor 66. First order cancels either way; the whole
penalty lands on the second-order dispersion term, so the mistake is invisible on
a linear lattice and ruinous on a real one.

Do not do that subtraction here. Build a mandatory
:class:`tmom_recon.ReconstructionFrame` from the measured positions and fitted
momenta, then pass only the measurement momentum offset to ``tmom_recon``.
