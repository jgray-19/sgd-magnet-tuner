"""Analysis utilities that inspect a fit without changing the optimisation.

Currently this exposes the degeneracy checker, which examines the Gauss-Newton
normal matrix ``A = JᵀWJ`` to reveal knob combinations the measurement cannot
constrain - the flat directions that make an optimiser wander instead of
converging to a unique minimum.
