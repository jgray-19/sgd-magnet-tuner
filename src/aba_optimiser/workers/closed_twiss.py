"""Closed-twiss worker: fit knobs to a measured periodic optics solution.

Runs one MAD-NG ``twiss`` per iteration with the optimisation knobs installed as
TPSA parameters on the sequence. twiss finds the parametric closed orbit with
``cofind`` and normalises the parametric one-turn map, so the closed orbit, beta,
alpha, phase and dispersion at every BPM are the *periodic* solution of the ring
as a function of the knobs.

The optical functions and their knob derivatives are requested through twiss's
own ``trkopt`` list, which fills one mtable column per requested name; the knob
monomial is encoded in the name, so ``beta11_`` is the value and
``beta11_0..010..0`` is its derivative with respect to knob ``i``. The closed
orbit is the exception - ``x``/``y`` are not optical functions, so their scalar
comes from the ordinary twiss column and their Jacobian from the saved map.

Nothing is seeded from the measurement. There is no starting point to propagate
from, so no measurement noise enters as an initial condition and no error can be
absorbed by an assumed anchor; every residual is attributable to the magnets.
