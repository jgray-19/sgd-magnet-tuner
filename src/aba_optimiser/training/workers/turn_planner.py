"""Turn-batch planning for tracking workers.

Batching is intentionally simple: the caller (``DataManager``) has already carved
out the held-out validation turns and applied ``data_fraction`` sampling, so the
turns handed to the planner are exactly the training turns to be used. The planner
only has to spread those turns evenly across the batches implied by
``num_workers`` (one batch per turn-group, later fanned out over range specs).
