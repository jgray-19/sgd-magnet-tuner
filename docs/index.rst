aba_optimiser documentation
===========================

``aba_optimiser`` is a worker-based optimisation toolkit for accelerator magnet
studies. The current documentation is intentionally narrow: it focuses on the
API surface that is exercised by the automated tests and used by the main
controller-driven runtime.

Use this site as a reference for:

* accelerator definitions and runtime configuration dataclasses
* MAD interface classes used to construct optimisation problems
* controller, worker, and optimiser APIs
* tested utility modules that support data preparation and analysis

Workflow guides and campaign-specific scripts are intentionally left out of the
published docs until they have stronger validation coverage.

GitHub Dependencies
-------------------

Some parts of the repository rely on companion packages installed directly from
GitHub rather than PyPI-only dependencies:

* ``pymadng-utils`` provides shared accelerator abstractions plus MAD/MAD-X
  helper utilities such as knob file IO and interface glue used throughout the
  core runtime.
* ``tmom-recon`` provides transverse and longitudinal momentum reconstruction,
  AC-dipole measurement helpers, and optics reconstruction routines used by the
  measurement and optics-oriented code paths.
* ``xtrack-tools`` provides tracking helpers, environment initialisation, and
  dataframe conversion utilities used by the higher-fidelity controller and
  simulation tests.

These dependencies are important because the tested end-to-end workflows in
this repository are built around a larger accelerator-tooling stack rather than
standalone numerical routines.

Squeeze Measurement Reconstruction
----------------------------------

The LHC squeeze pipeline follows the current ``tmom-recon`` and
``pymadng-utils`` conventions:

* Batch squeeze processing uses the one-shot
  ``tmom_recon.calculate_pz(..., acd_only=True)`` path. The
  ``acd_only="generator"`` path is reserved for live optics updates where the
  same cleaned measurement is recomputed many times after magnet changes.
* The MAD-NG model is updated with both the natural tunes and the driven
  AC-dipole tunes via ``update_model_with_madng(..., tunes=..., drv_tunes=...)``.
* The reconstruction Twiss is expected to be on-momentum. Momentum offsets are
  carried through MAD-NG ``pt``; using an off-momentum Twiss would subtract a
  dispersive closed orbit from the measured positions and bias the reconstructed
  phase space.
* The saved squeeze parquet keeps the usual BPM rows and appends the
  ``<acd>_before`` / ``<acd>_after`` marker rows emitted by ``tmom-recon`` so
  downstream ACD optimisation can initialise bidirectional tracking at the
  reconstructed marker states.
* Tune and corrector knob files extracted for each measurement frequency are
  passed into the ACD MAD-NG driver, matching the optics state used for the
  corresponding turn-by-turn measurement.
* When b2 dipole error tables are enabled, the MAD interface requires a tune
  knob file. Applying b2 errors shifts the machine tunes, so the interface
  applies the error table and then restores the tunes before creating
  optimisation knobs.
